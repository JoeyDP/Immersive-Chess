### 1. Creating a Chess Case

The first item you need is a chess case to contain your pieces.

Don't worry about having to build your own pieces just yet. You can always start a chess game with the default pieces.

### 2. Build a Chess Board

A chess board can be built in the world with any solid blocks. Simply choose two vanilla blocks that ideally have contrasting colors and create an eight by eight checkerboard pattern. Make sure the edges are of a different block to create a valid board.

Then right-click the board to turn it into a chess game.

When a game is active, you can right-click the board with an empty hand to open the game GUI. This GUI contains statistics of the game and the option to resign, offer draw or accept draw. You can also change which set of pieces is used for rendering (default, own or opponent's).

### 3. Build your own Pieces

Want to design your own set of chess pieces? Each one has its own `Piece Structure Block` you can craft.

The dye indicates the color of the piece (black dye or white dye) and the signature item determines the type as follows

Once you have all six structure blocks also craft some `Piece Stands` to save your piece with.

Now it's time for building. Simply place the structure block down and build your piece inside the outline. A `Piece Stand` can be placed inside with right-click to store the miniature version. Right-click again to take it out and store it inside you chess case to be used.
